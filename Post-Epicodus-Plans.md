# Action Plan:
   Securing my first job post-Epicodus is priority number one for me. Over the past two weeks, I've applied to 6 positions ranging from software developer to QA. Once classes end, I plan to focus on applications  and to apply to 3-4 positions per week. In order to maximize my efficiency, I must continue to build a solid network within the Portland tech community, which includes connecting with colleagues from Airbnb and attending frequent meet-ups. By being active in this sense, I can leverage my interpersonal skills with my growing understanding of software development.
